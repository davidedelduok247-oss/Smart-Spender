Smart Spender – Budget Tracking Web App (Capstone Project)
■ Overview
Smart Spender is a front-end budgeting web application created as a Capstone Project to demonstrate group collaboration, UI design, and simulated financial-tracking functionality. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application simulates a login system, a dashboard, and realistic user interactions. Smart Spender empowers users to take control of their financial lives by allowing them to log income and expenses, set budgets, monitor spending trends, and track financial goals — all through an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface. Whether someone is saving for a vacation, paying off debt, or simply trying to understand where their money goes each month, Smart Spender provides a clear and accessible demonstration of how a personal finance tool could work.

■ Project Goals
• Demonstrate how a budgeting system would operate. • Show collaborative UI planning and execution. • Simulate user login and dashboard behavior. • Provide a clean and modern front-end demonstration. • Build the interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

■ Tech Stack
• HTML5 (structure) • CSS3 (styling) • JavaScript (logic and simulation) • LocalStorage (fake database) • Canva or Figma (wireframes)

■ Folder Structure
Smart-Spender/ • index.html – Login page • dashboard.html – Main dashboard • styles.css –
All styling • script.js – Simulated backend logic

■ How Login Works
The login system uses a predefined demo account stored directly in JavaScript. JavaScript checks the credentials and simulates a ‘logged in’ session using LocalStorage. If credentials match, the user is redirected to the dashboard.

■ Dashboard Features
The dashboard displays mock financial data such as monthly budget, expenses, remaining balance, and sample transactions. These values can be customized for demonstration purposes.

■ Logout Feature
A Logout button clears the LocalStorage session and returns the user to the login screen, simulating session handling in real applications.

■ Running the Project
To run the project, simply use Live Server in VS Code. No installation or backend setup is required.

■ Demo Credentials

■ Limitations
• No real authentication • No SQL • Not connected to real financial data • Intended only for demonstration

■ Future Enhancements
• Real backend with SQL or Firebase • Secure authentication • Dynamic charts • Editable categories and budgets • API integrations for bank data

■ Conclusion
Smart Spender demonstrates a clean UI, simulated functionality, and effective team collaboration. It fulfills all capstone project requirements while maintaining simplicity and clarity.
